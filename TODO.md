## Media keys and Now Playing (outside the TUI)

Hardware media keys (play/pause/next/previous) and the system Now Playing widget work on macOS with
[mpd-now-playable](https://git.00dani.me/00dani/mpd-now-playable), a separate daemon that talks to MPD directly, so
it works while rormpc is closed. Nothing in this repository describes it yet.

Current macOS setup:

    uv tool install mpd-now-playable
    mpd-now-playable install-launchagent            # writes ~/Library/LaunchAgents/me.00dani.mpd-now-playable.plist
                                                    # (RunAtLoad, KeepAlive), bootout + bootstrap + kickstart
    mpd-now-playable uninstall-launchagent          # removes it

The plist runs the uv tool venv's Python (`sys.executable -m mpd_now_playable.cli`), so a reinstall of the tool
or a change of its Python can leave launchd restarting a dead path: rerun `install-launchagent --force` after
`uv tool upgrade` / reinstall.

Plan (2026-10-03, after asking GPT-6.1 Sol and MiMo; both said "document first"):

- [ ] Document it in RORMPC.md ("Media keys" section): what it is, the commands above, how to check it
      (`launchctl print gui/$UID/me.00dani.mpd-now-playable`), the upgrade caveat, and that it is independent
      of rormpc.
- [ ] Do not fold it into `rormpc_install.sh install`: that script installs and rolls back the binary, and a
      binary rollback must not touch the service. If a helper is still wanted, make it a separate opt-in
      subcommand (e.g. `rormpc_install.sh media-keys install|status|uninstall`) that only calls the tool's own
      `install-launchagent` / `uninstall-launchagent`, never writes its own plist, and refuses to run a second
      Now Playing source.
- [ ] Linux: MPD has no MPRIS of its own; a bridge exposes it on the session D-Bus. Options: this
      repository's `rmpcd` (Rust, MPRIS server via zbus, off by default: `config.mpris = true` in
      `~/.config/rmpcd/init.lua`; upstream calls rmpcd early stage), `mpd-mpris` (Go; Arch: `pacman -S
      mpd-mpris`, ships a systemd user unit: `systemctl --user enable --now mpd-mpris`) or `mpDris2`. Run
      exactly one of them. GNOME/KDE map media keys to MPRIS themselves; other WMs need `playerctl` bindings.
  - Omarchy (Arch + Hyprland): `default/hypr/bindings/media.lua` binds XF86AudioPlay/Pause/Next/Prev to
    `omarchy-shell media playPause|next|previous`, a Quickshell service that drives the active MPRIS player.
    Omarchy ships no MPD and no MPD bridge, so the keys reach MPD once one bridge above runs. A playing
    browser or mpv can become the active player and take the keys; for MPD-only keys override the bindings
    with `playerctl -p <name from playerctl -l> play-pause|next|previous`. Try rmpcd first, `mpd-mpris`
    as the fallback.
  - Roguix (Guix, Omarchy look): same Hyprland bindings and `playerctl` are installed; MPD and a bridge are
    not. Guix reportedly packages `mpdris2` (and recently `mpdris2-rs`): check with `guix show mpdris2
    mpdris2-rs` on the pinned channel. Otherwise package rmpcd in roguix-channel. Run it as a Guix Home
    Shepherd service (`home-shepherd-service-type`) and check that it lands on the Hyprland session's D-Bus.
- [ ] Rust instead of the Python tool on macOS. Asked GPT-6.1 Sol and MiMo twice on 2026-10-03; both say keep
      mpd-now-playable (it works, 50 MB RSS is not a real cost), and if it is replaced, by a standalone port,
      not inside rmpcd (rmpcd is the Linux zbus/MPRIS daemon; a macOS stack in it doubles its platforms).
      - What there is to port: mpd-now-playable 1.6.2 (MIT) is ~1900 lines of Python, but the macOS part is
        ~110 (`receivers/cocoa/now_playing.py`): `NSApplication` with the accessory activation policy,
        `MPRemoteCommandCenter` handlers for play/pause/toggle/stop/next/previous and
        `changePlaybackPosition` (seek), rate/skip commands disabled, `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` info and
        playback state, and state forced to Playing at startup so the keys can resume a paused MPD. No app
        bundle, no Info.plist, no audio of its own.
      - Its threading answer: one thread. `corefoundationasyncio.CoreFoundationEventLoop` is an asyncio loop
        that runs on the main thread's CFRunLoop, so MPD I/O and the Cocoa callbacks share it. Rust has no
        such tokio loop, but none is needed: `rmpc-mpd` is a blocking client (std `TcpStream`; `idle`,
        `read_picture`, `albumart`). Main thread: AppKit run loop. One std thread: MPD idle loop, sending
        snapshots to the main queue (GCD `dispatch` main queue); remote command handlers return at once and
        send the command to a second MPD connection.
      - Bindings: `objc2`, `objc2-app-kit`, `objc2-media-player`, `block2` directly, for exact control of
        commands and playback state (souvlaki/playwire hide part of it).
      - Keep: transport commands, seek, title/artist/album/duration/elapsed (on idle events and seeks, no
        1 Hz ticking), artwork with a size cap, reconnect with backoff and a full refresh after reconnect and
        wake, a tiny config (MPD address). Drop: redis/memcached, websockets, MusicBrainz.
      - Watch: forcing Playing at startup can take the Now Playing slot from Music/Spotify/a browser while
        MPD is paused (maybe claim it on the first MPD activity instead); ad-hoc sign the binary for local use.
      - Where it lives (asked Sol and MiMo again, both chose this): a new crate in this workspace, e.g.
        `rormpc-now-playable` (thin macOS binary, target-gated objc2 deps; MPD-state mapping in its own
        module that rmpcd could use later), reusing `rmpc-mpd`. Not a dependency of the TUI: the keys must
        work while rormpc is closed. Not inside rmpcd for now: rmpcd is unused here, early stage, tokio + Lua,
        and edits there would conflict on every rebase. Only the workspace `members` line touches upstream.
      - Daemons on the Mac stay at three: mpd, listenbrainz-mpd, the port (it replaces mpd-now-playable;
        never run both). Do not start rmpcd on macOS and do not move scrobbling into it (its plugin is
        Last.fm, not ListenBrainz).
      - Install: an opt-in `rormpc_install.sh now-playable install|uninstall|rollback`, separate from the
        TUI install; on install it uninstalls mpd-now-playable's LaunchAgent, rollback restores it.
      - The idle thread blocks in `idle` and MPD accepts only `noidle` then, so commands from the keys go
        through a second connection (a command worker), never the idle one.
      - Estimates from the models: a proof of concept in a day or two, as reliable as the Python tool in
        one to two weeks. Spike first: a launchd-started binary that receives play/pause and shows a title.
- [ ] Windows: no plan unless MPD on Windows is actually used (SMTC, e.g. via souvlaki; needs a hidden HWND with a
      message pump).
- [ ] Whatever is documented, check: works with rormpc closed, survives MPD restart and sleep/wake, clears
      stale metadata when playback stops, uninstall leaves MPD alone.

## Modals and the context menu: mouse

Reported 2026-10-03. Causes found in the code:

- No hover in the context menu: `shared/mouse_event.rs` maps `CTMouseEventKind::Moved` to `None`, so motion never
  reaches widgets (crossterm's `EnableMouseCapture` already requests any-motion reports, ?1003).
- A menu entry needs a double click: `MenuModal::handle_mouse_event` only selects on `LeftClick` and confirms on
  `DoubleClick`.
- A click outside a modal does nothing: `Ui::handle_mouse_event` hands every event to `modals.last_mut()` without a
  hit test, and the `Modal` trait has no area.
- No dimmed background: `Ui::render` already has `theme.modal_backdrop` (sets `fg(DarkGray)` on the whole buffer, which
  flattens all colours); the `roman` theme has it off. herdr adds `Modifier::DIM` to every cell instead (colours kept),
  and dims dialogs but not its context menu or navigator.

Plan (asked GPT-6.1 Sol and MiMo on 2026-10-03; both agreed on the points below):

- [ ] Menu: hover selects the entry under the cursor, a single left click confirms it. One hit-test function shared by
      hover and click (headers, separators, borders, scrolling); a click on blank space never runs the selected entry.
      Redraw only when the selection changes.
- [ ] `Moved`: pass it on only while a modal that wants hover is open; drop it early otherwise, so motion causes no
      redraws or wakeups elsewhere. Check that nothing treats any mouse event as activity.
- [ ] Click-through: double clicks are synthesised from two left clicks, so once one click closes the menu the second
      one arrives as `DoubleClick` on the pane underneath and can play/add a song. Reset the double-click tracker
      when a modal closes on a click (or swallow the next click at that position).
- [ ] Outside click: an opt-in per modal (e.g. `fn layout(&self, frame: Rect) -> Option<Rect>` computed the same way
      as in `render`, no stored rect, so it is right before the first render and after a resize; `None` means "not
      dismissible"). Menu, select, info, keybinds, outputs, decoders: close (same path as Esc). Input: cancel like Esc,
      never submit. Confirm / destructive modals: never close on an outside click. Swallow the click and wheel events
      outside instead of passing them through.
- [ ] Backdrop: switch `modal_backdrop` to `Modifier::DIM` like herdr and enable it in the `roman` theme; decide
      whether the context menu dims (herdr does not). Popups must start from `Clear` or they inherit DIM. Check in
      Ghostty and kitty (`faint-opacity` / `dim_opacity` decide how strong it is) and with bold/reversed selections.
- [ ] Order: menu hover + single click with the click-through fix first, outside click second, backdrop last.
