## Media keys and Now Playing (outside the TUI)

Hardware media keys (play/pause/next/previous) and the system Now Playing widget work on macOS with
[mpd-now-playable](https://git.00dani.me/00dani/mpd-now-playable), a separate daemon that talks to MPD directly, so
it works while rormpc is closed. Nothing in this repository describes it yet.

Current macOS setup:

    uv tool install mpd-now-playable
    mpd-now-playable install-launchagent            # writes ~/Library/LaunchAgents/me.00dani.mpd-now-playable.plist
                                                    # (RunAtLoad, KeepAlive), bootout + bootstrap + kickstart
    mpd-now-playable uninstall-launchagent          # removes it

The plist runs the uv tool venv's Python (`sys.executable -m mpd_now_playable.cli`), so a reinstall of the tool
or a change of its Python can leave launchd restarting a dead path: rerun `install-launchagent --force` after
`uv tool upgrade` / reinstall.

Plan (2026-10-03, after asking GPT-6.1 Sol and MiMo; both said "document first"):

- [ ] Document it in RORMPC.md ("Media keys" section): what it is, the commands above, how to check it
      (`launchctl print gui/$UID/me.00dani.mpd-now-playable`), the upgrade caveat, and that it is independent
      of rormpc.
- [ ] Do not fold it into `rormpc_install.sh install`: that script installs and rolls back the binary, and a
      binary rollback must not touch the service. If a helper is still wanted, make it a separate opt-in
      subcommand (e.g. `rormpc_install.sh media-keys install|status|uninstall`) that only calls the tool's own
      `install-launchagent` / `uninstall-launchagent`, never writes its own plist, and refuses to run a second
      Now Playing source.
- [ ] Linux: MPD has no MPRIS of its own; a bridge exposes it on the session D-Bus. Options: this
      repository's `rmpcd` (Rust, MPRIS server via zbus, off by default: `config.mpris = true` in
      `~/.config/rmpcd/init.lua`; upstream calls rmpcd early stage), `mpd-mpris` (Go; Arch: `pacman -S
      mpd-mpris`, ships a systemd user unit: `systemctl --user enable --now mpd-mpris`) or `mpDris2`. Run
      exactly one of them. GNOME/KDE map media keys to MPRIS themselves; other WMs need `playerctl` bindings.
  - Omarchy (Arch + Hyprland): `default/hypr/bindings/media.lua` binds XF86AudioPlay/Pause/Next/Prev to
    `omarchy-shell media playPause|next|previous`, a Quickshell service that drives the active MPRIS player.
    Omarchy ships no MPD and no MPD bridge, so the keys reach MPD once one bridge above runs. A playing
    browser or mpv can become the active player and take the keys; for MPD-only keys override the bindings
    with `playerctl -p <name from playerctl -l> play-pause|next|previous`. Try rmpcd first, `mpd-mpris`
    as the fallback.
  - Roguix (Guix, Omarchy look): same Hyprland bindings and `playerctl` are installed; MPD and a bridge are
    not. Guix reportedly packages `mpdris2` (and recently `mpdris2-rs`): check with `guix show mpdris2
    mpdris2-rs` on the pinned channel. Otherwise package rmpcd in roguix-channel. Run it as a Guix Home
    Shepherd service (`home-shepherd-service-type`) and check that it lands on the Hyprland session's D-Bus.
- [ ] Rust instead of the Python tool on macOS. Asked GPT-6.1 Sol and MiMo twice on 2026-10-03; both say keep
      mpd-now-playable (it works, 50 MB RSS is not a real cost), and if it is replaced, by a standalone port,
      not inside rmpcd (rmpcd is the Linux zbus/MPRIS daemon; a macOS stack in it doubles its platforms).
      - What there is to port: mpd-now-playable 1.6.2 (MIT) is ~1900 lines of Python, but the macOS part is
        ~110 (`receivers/cocoa/now_playing.py`): `NSApplication` with the accessory activation policy,
        `MPRemoteCommandCenter` handlers for play/pause/toggle/stop/next/previous and
        `changePlaybackPosition` (seek), rate/skip commands disabled, `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` info and
        playback state, and state forced to Playing at startup so the keys can resume a paused MPD. No app
        bundle, no Info.plist, no audio of its own.
      - Its threading answer: one thread. `corefoundationasyncio.CoreFoundationEventLoop` is an asyncio loop
        that runs on the main thread's CFRunLoop, so MPD I/O and the Cocoa callbacks share it. Rust has no
        such tokio loop, but none is needed: `rmpc-mpd` is a blocking client (std `TcpStream`; `idle`,
        `read_picture`, `albumart`). Main thread: AppKit run loop. One std thread: MPD idle loop, sending
        snapshots to the main queue (GCD `dispatch` main queue); remote command handlers return at once and
        send the command to a second MPD connection.
      - Bindings: `objc2`, `objc2-app-kit`, `objc2-media-player`, `block2` directly, for exact control of
        commands and playback state (souvlaki/playwire hide part of it).
      - Keep: transport commands, seek, title/artist/album/duration/elapsed (on idle events and seeks, no
        1 Hz ticking), artwork with a size cap, reconnect with backoff and a full refresh after reconnect and
        wake, a tiny config (MPD address). Drop: redis/memcached, websockets, MusicBrainz.
      - Watch: forcing Playing at startup can take the Now Playing slot from Music/Spotify/a browser while
        MPD is paused (maybe claim it on the first MPD activity instead); ad-hoc sign the binary for local use.
      - Estimates from the models: a proof of concept in a day or two, as reliable as the Python tool in
        one to two weeks. Spike first: a launchd-started binary that receives play/pause and shows a title.
- [ ] Windows: no plan unless MPD on Windows is actually used (SMTC, e.g. via souvlaki; needs a hidden HWND with a
      message pump).
- [ ] Whatever is documented, check: works with rormpc closed, survives MPD restart and sleep/wake, clears
      stale metadata when playback stops, uninstall leaves MPD alone.
